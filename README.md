## About

My keyboard layout made to be as similar to a normal Windows/Linux keyboard layout.
Made using [Ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/) and forked from [PetorSFZ/MacOSX-Improved-Swedish-Keyboard-Layout](https://github.com/PetorSFZ/MacOSX-Improved-Swedish-Keyboard-Layout).

## Installation

Save [this link](https://github.com/brugr/macos-swedish-keyboard/archive/master.zip) and unextract it.

Copy the `.keylayout` files to

	/Library/Keyboard Layouts (All users)
	~/Library/Keyboard Layouts (Only current user)
	
and restart your Mac. You can then choose the 'Swedish - Normal' layout from System Preferences.

Note that if you don't copy them to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts` then you won't be able to use them on the lock screen and in password dialoges.

## Difference between Normal and Normal-Fix

The only difference between Normal and Normal-Fix is the placement of the `§ (½)` and `< (>)` keys. Normal has them in the correct spot meanwhile Normal-Fix has them reversed. I only made it because my laptop keyboard has those keys reversed.
